# What about you?

Turn to the person next to you and introduce yourselves! 

Share:

* Your major (if known)
* Your year
* One (1) fun fact about yourself


Statistics is by nature a collaborative discipline! I hope that you can work together in class and outside of class. Homework needs to be turned in individually but working in groups is allowed! Exams ofcrouse are individual.

# Why I love statistics

* It's fun being able to draw meaningful conclusions from data!
* The mathematics of statistics is challenging but gratifying
* On a philsophical level, statistics has the power to discern truth and enhance human knowledge
